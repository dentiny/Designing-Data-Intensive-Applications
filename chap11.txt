1. Why not direct communication between producers and consumers?
(1) speed mismatch(message broker buffers)
(2) what if node failure? (message broker provides fault tolerance)

2. log-based message broker:
(1) provides total ordering within partition, no ordering guarentee across
partitions
(2) could be used to keep heterogeneous consumers in sync(eg, data warehouse,
search index, etc)
(3) logs stored at circular bounded buffer on disk
