relational model:
(1) many-to-many relaion
(2) data relationship explicit(schema-on-write)
(3)poor data locality

document model:
(1) self-contained document-like structure
  - document-like structure: a tree of one-many relationships
(2) relationship between one document and another is rare
  - doesn't support well for many-to-many relation and join operation
(3) two types of schema:
1/ schema-on-read: structure of data is implicit, only interpreted when data is
read
2/ schema-on-write: schema is explicit, db ensures all written data conforms
document model takes schema-on-read, relational model takes schema-on-write
(4) limitation: it's encouraged to keep documents small and avoid writes that
increase the size of a document: if modifications that change the encoded size
of the document, the ensure document needs to be rewritten

graph model:
(1) target use cases where anything's potentially related to everything
  - many-to-many relationship is common
