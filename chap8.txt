1. How to achieve bounded delay(hard to achieve)(P286)
(1) QoS(Quality of Service): technique that manages data traffic to reduce
packet loss, latenc, jitter
(2) admission control: check before establishing connection

2. LWW(Last Write Wins) widely accepted, problem on physical time decision:
(1) time-of-day clock:
1/ clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME) returns time passed since epoch
2/ if synchronized with NTP, could jump forward or backward
(2) monotonous clock:
1/ clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)
2/ if synchronized NTP, doesn't jump forward or backward, but allows the clock
frequency to speed up or down
3/ doesn't represent absolute time. but guarentee monotonous on single machine 
(actually single CPU)
4/ good to measure elapsed time
(3) could sync-up by NTP (Network Tiime Protocal)
	potential problem: NTP daemon misconfiguration, firewall blocks NTP traffic,
	clock error due to drift becomes large

3. process could suspend, don't make assumptions upon that
(1) suspension reason: P296
(2) bad code example: P296

4. The truth is defined by the majority.

5. lease alone doesn't guarantee exclusive access
- i.e. GC (Garbage Collection) could lead to several minutes stall
- should use lease + fencing token instead (an atomic counter indicates whether
lease version is still the latest)
